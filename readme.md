This is an outrages
Why Hittite does not write the driver for general purpose controller with
GPIo's by them self.

So i tried to help here and bring you a solution with Diolan adapter that
have many things 

The gpio read and write registers + the a user control that let you control
the hmc704lp4e

hope it will help
to me it took week to get it done

Enjoy
